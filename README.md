# Support Vector Machines
Primer for understanding the math that builds Support Vector Machines

Support Vector Machines are an incredibly powerful tool in the world of machine learning. They present a relatively simple and cost effective method of approaching problems primarily involving classification but can be extended to other applications. It differs from many other machine learning methods in that its process of finding boundaries on which to classify unique elements is based on an optimization problem. So not only is the algorithm competitive in its cost efficiency but it also guarentees finding global optimum. These two factors make SVM's incredibly attractive and widely applicable in a variety of real world problems.
